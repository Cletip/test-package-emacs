(defcustom unevariable (concat user-emacs-directory "test")
  "Directory for storing personal notes.

A safe local value of either `default-directory' or `local' can
be added as a value in a .dir-local.el file.  Do this if you
intend to use multiple directory silos for your notes while still
relying on a global value (which is the value of this variable).
The Denote manual has a sample (search for '.dir-locals.el').
Those silos do not communicate with each other: they remain
separate.

The local value influences where commands such as `denote' will
place the newly created note.  If the command is called from a
directory or file where the local value exists, then that value
take precedence, otherwise the global value is used.

If you intend to reference this variable in Lisp, consider using
the function `denote-directory' instead: it returns the path as a
directory and also checks if a safe local value should be used."
